# layout
In this Chapter, we learn that the `app.layout` describes what the app looks like and is a hierarchical tree of components. The *DashHtmlComponents* package provides classes for all of the HTML tags, and the keyword arguments describe the HTML attributes like `style, className, and id`. The *DashCoreComponents* package generates higher level components like `controls and graphs`.
